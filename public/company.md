# About Pullse

## Our Mission

Build AI-native software that solves entire business functions—not just adds chatbots to legacy tools.

## The Problem We're Solving

Support teams are drowning in tool sprawl. The average team uses:
- Zendesk/Freshdesk for ticketing
- Intercom/Drift for live chat
- Separate chatbot platform
- Standalone QA tool (Klaus, MaestroQA)
- Analytics SaaS
- Knowledge base software
- Help desk reporting tool
- Workflow automation platform (Zapier)
- Plus 5-10 integrations to make it all work

**Result**: Agents switch between 10+ tools per ticket. Customers wait longer. Costs spiral.

## Our Solution

Pullse replaces your entire customer support stack with one AI-native platform. Everything you need from day one:
- **Unified Inbox**: Email, live chat, voice, social—all channels in one feed
- **Autonomous AI Agents**: Resolve 60-70% of inquiries without human intervention
- **Team Copilots**: On-demand AI assistant that executes actions (refunds, account updates, API calls)
- **Auto-QA**: AI evaluates every conversation and provides personalized coaching
- **Help Centers**: Unlimited self-service knowledge bases (Pro plan)
- **Workflows**: Visual builder for routing, automation, and SLA management
- **Analytics**: Pre-built dashboards + custom reports

**No feature crippling. No add-ons. Transparent pricing.**

## Our Story

### Founded: November 2024

**Why we started Pullse:**

Support software is stuck in 2010. Every major platform—Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk—was built before modern AI existed. They've spent the last 2 years bolting on chatbots and calling it "AI-powered."

We saw an opportunity to build differently: a platform architected from day one for LLM-powered support. Not a chatbot add-on. Not a Zendesk clone with GPT-4 sprinkled on top. A fundamentally new approach.

### Backed by Antler

## Our Values

### 1. **Customer Obsession**
We build for support teams, not investors. If a feature doesn't make agents' lives easier or customers happier, we don't ship it.

### 2. **Radical Transparency**
- Public pricing (no "contact sales" gatekeeping)
- Open roadmap (see what we're building next)
- Honest communication about what we don't do yet

### 3. **AI-Native, Not AI-Washed**
We don't slap GPT-4 on legacy software and call it innovation. Every feature is designed for LLM capabilities: multi-turn conversations, context retention, action execution.

### 4. **No Feature Crippling**
Both plans (Standard & Pro) get access to all core features from day one. We charge for usage (credits), not feature access.

### 5. **Speed to Value**
Teams should get value in days, not months. Our average time-to-first-resolution: 3 days from signup to first AI-deflected ticket.

## Product Philosophy

### What We Believe

**AI should do the boring work, not replace humans.**
- Chatbots handle WISMO, password resets, order tracking
- Agents focus on complex, high-value conversations
- Copilot eliminates repetitive tasks (refunds, account lookups)

**Consolidation > Best-of-breed.**
- One login, one UI, one source of truth
- No Zapier duct tape between 10 tools
- Seamless experience for agents and customers

**Transparency > hidden fees.**
- No "contact sales" pricing
- No surprise add-on costs
- Clear credit system (you know exactly what you'll pay)

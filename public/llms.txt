# Pullse - AI-Native Customer Support Platform

> Pullse is an AI-native customer support platform that replaces your entire stack—Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, plus 10+ fragmented tools—with one unified system. Built on LLM technology with multi-turn conversation handling, autonomous AI agents with configurable guardrails, team copilots with action execution capabilities, automated quality assurance scoring, and self-service help centers. Transparent pricing: Standard $49/seat/month, Pro $79/seat/month, plus pay-per-use credits at $0.08-0.10 each. Launching Q4 2025.

Pullse consolidates ticketing, live chat, AI chatbots, knowledge bases, QA automation, and analytics into a single AI-native platform. Unlike legacy tools retrofitted with AI features, Pullse is architected from the ground up for LLM-powered support operations, handling complex multi-turn conversations, dynamic context switching, and intelligent action execution.

## Credit System

### What Are Credits?

Credits power AI features beyond your plan's included amounts. 1 credit = 1 action:
- 1 chatbot conversation
- 1 copilot action (refund, account update, data lookup, etc.)

### Credit Pricing

**Pay-as-you-go**: $0.10/credit (auto-charged when you exceed included credits)
**Pre-committed**: $0.08/credit (purchase 100+ credits upfront, 20% savings)

### Example Credit Usage

**Standard Plan** (10 agents):
- Base: $490/month (10 × $49)
- Included: 50 chatbot + 200 copilot (20 per seat × 10)
- Typical usage: 150 chatbot + 350 copilot
- Overage: 100 chatbot + 150 copilot = 250 credits
- **Cost**: $490 + (250 × $0.10) = **$515/month**

**Pro Plan** (10 agents):
- Base: $790/month (10 × $79)
- Included: 100 chatbot + 500 copilot (50 per seat × 10)
- Typical usage: 200 chatbot + 600 copilot
- Overage: 100 chatbot + 100 copilot = 200 credits
- **Cost**: $790 + (200 × $0.08) = **$806/month** (using pre-committed rate)

# AI Engine - Autonomous Support Agent

## Overview

Pullse's AI Engine powers autonomous customer-facing chatbots that resolve 60-70% of support inquiries without human intervention, while maintaining safety through configurable guardrails and escalation rules.

## Key Capabilities

### Autonomous Resolution
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Handles complex back-and-forth dialogues with context retention across multiple messages
- **Intent Recognition**: Accurately identifies customer needs from natural language queries
- **Action Execution**: Performs actions like processing refunds, updating account info, checking order status
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Semantic search across all help center articles and internal documentation
- **Escalation Intelligence**: Knows when to hand off to human agents based on confidence scores and complexity

### Guardrails & Safety
- **Configurable Boundaries**: Set hard limits on what AI can and cannot do (e.g., max refund amount, account changes)
- **Approval Workflows**: Require human confirmation for high-risk actions
- **Sentiment Monitoring**: Automatically escalate frustrated or angry customers
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Grounded responses only from your knowledge base - no made-up information
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all AI decisions and actions for compliance

### Customization
- **Brand Voice**: Train the AI to match your company's tone (professional, friendly, casual, etc.)
- **Custom Actions**: Connect to your APIs to enable chatbot actions beyond standard operations
- **Conditional Logic**: Set business rules for when/how the AI should respond or escalate
- **Multi-language**: Supports 50+ languages with automatic detection and response
- **Context Awareness**: Integrates with CRM to personalize responses based on customer history

## Setup & Configuration

2. **Actions**: Connect APIs for refunds, order lookups, account updates
3. **Guardrails**: Define safety rules and escalation triggers
4. **Brand Voice**: Set tone guidelines and response templates
5. **Testing**: Use sandbox mode to validate AI responses before going live

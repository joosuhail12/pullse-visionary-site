# B2B SaaS Solution

## Overview

Purpose-built for SaaS companies managing technical support, API documentation, product usage, and customer success workflows.

## Key Challenges

1. **Technical Support Complexity**: Agents need access to code, logs, API docs mid-conversation
2. **Tool Sprawl**: Switching between 10+ tools (Zendesk, Jira, Stripe, analytics, CRM)
3. **API/Developer Support**: Self-service docs don't cover edge cases
4. **Subscription Management**: Manual upgrades/downgrades slow down customer requests
5. **Product Adoption**: Hard to track feature usage and identify expansion opportunities

## Pullse Solution

### Unified Technical Support
- **Integrated Dev Tools**: Pull Jira tickets, GitHub issues, error logs directly in support UI
- **Code Sample Insertion**: AI suggests relevant API examples from documentation
- **Log Analysis**: Copilot interprets error messages and suggests fixes
- **API Key Management**: Chatbot generates/rotates API keys with one command
- **Technical Knowledge Base**: Searchable code samples, SDK guides, API references

### Subscription & Billing Automation
- **Self-Service Upgrades**: Customers upgrade plans via chatbot
- **Usage-Based Billing Support**: Real-time usage lookups from Stripe/payment processor
- **Proration Calculations**: AI explains pro-rated charges for mid-cycle changes
- **Cancellation Workflows**: Retention copilot offers discounts/pause options before cancel

### Customer Success Integration

- **Onboarding Automation**: Chatbot guides new customers through setup steps
- **Proactive Outreach**: Trigger CSM tasks when support patterns indicate risk
